## Projects

### 1. Emotion Detection
- **File**: `Emotion_Detection.ipynb`
- **Description**: This project detects emotions using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify different emotions from facial expressions or other input data.

### 2. Gender Classification
- **File**: `Gender_Classification___CNN.ipynb`
- **Description**: A deep learning-based project using CNNs for gender classification. The model classifies individuals as male or female based on the input image or other features.

### 3. House Price Prediction
- **File**: `house_price_predictions - Jupyter Notebook.pdf`
- **Description**: This project predicts house prices using both machine learning models like linear regression and deep learning models. Various features such as area, number of rooms, and location are used to build a predictive model.

### 4. Movie Recommendation System
- **File**: `movie_pred_system.ipynb`
- **Description**: A hybrid approach using machine learning and deep learning models to recommend movies based on user preferences. The project applies collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and neural networks for accurate recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
  - **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For coding and model training
